<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game Rules</h1>

<p><strong>1. Game Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</li>
    <li>Players take turns, and the first move alternates between Player 1 and Player 2 at the start of each game.</li>
    <li>Each player is assigned a symbol ("X" or "O") at the beginning of each game.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Making a Move:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Players tap on an empty cell to place their symbol on the grid during their turn.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Form a line of three of your symbols ("X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Scoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A player receives 1 point for forming a winning line.</li>

    <li>If the game ends in a draw, with no winning lines, neither player receives any points.</li>
    <li>If a player achieves two winning lines simultaneously or wins from two sides (diagonal and either row or column), they receive 2 points.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Game End:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The game ends when one player forms a winning line or the entire grid is filled with symbols without a winner.</li>
   
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Restart and Score Reset:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Players can restart the game by tapping a "Restart" button.</li>
    <li>The score can be reset to zero for both players with a "Reset Score" button.</li>
</ul>
